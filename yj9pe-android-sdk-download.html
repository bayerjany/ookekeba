Does anyone else believe VS Code should become the new default IDE (it's more of an IDE now that an editor) for Flutter and Dart? I've tried and used both and there's no denying now that VS Code is faster and more focused. amp#x200B; Development time on VS Code goes down in comparison to Android Studio. amp#x200B; Android Studio (AS) simply has too much bloat.

So I'm currently working through the "Developing Android Apps" course as part of Udacity, and currently on a lesson to put items on the action bar. Following their video, as seen here (https://i.imgur.com/Z8Laxyb.jpg), they have suggested functions come up for this. However, when I try and do the same (https://i.imgur.com/RVKHntB.png), I get none of the suggested options. I suspect I'm missing something but can't figure out what. Is anybody able to offer advice. Hello I'm new to android development. I'm following an essentials course on Lynda. The instructor was explaining things regarding which SDK platforms and tools to install. But I'm confused about the SDK platforms. What are they exactly? This is what is in front of me right now. https://imgur.com/a/D5G4X I want to develop an app that supports as far back as android 4.4 for example. Should I install everything from 4.4 to 8.1? Or is this just for testing purposes? In this case, my phone Hello everyone. Today I tried to run a very simple "game" on my android using GMS 1.4 professional edition using Android/Fire (Test). After several hours of setting up the system to run a game, I stumbled upon a problem which I can't solve. Screenshot1 (https://imgur.com/WeuOqsk). I've found a document which I should edit (as far as I understood). Screenshot2 (https://imgur.com/a/0YNjg8E). I edited it by adding a little piece which was in the compiler on first Screenshot. Edited: Screensh. I've been messing around with unity for over a year and I've made a few games. I'm still learning the ropes so I wanted to make a mobile side-scrolling infinite learner to improve my skills. The game works (99.9% bug free), but I can't do an Android build! I've tried EVERYTHING to try and get it to work! Every time I think I'm making progress, a new error pops up. Sometimes Unity can't list target platforms, sometimes Unity says that the platform-tools is the wrong version (0.0.0) I've installed Android Studio and an android phone emulator to try and create a basic app. My computer is from 2013 and it is quite often maxing out the CPU and RAM. I haven't had this problem with just using IntelliJ, but that might be because it was used to do assignments at college and not making a real project?? Creating a website also didn't seem to take that much computing hardware. I installed Fedora 27 on my Thinkpad T460 and until now never had any similar problems (I even installed andoid studio on the previous Fedora installation without a problem). During the Fedora setup I choose automatic partitioning with encryption. Now yesterday I wanted to install android studio and during the download of the sdk I got an error message that a download could not be executed. I tried to manually download the file but firefox told me my tmp partition is full. I tried to check. 
So by the title.u can probably tell I'm a beginner.I was trying to install Android Studio earlier and I ran the setup.then it created a shortcut on the desktop.I clicked on it and it ran through a wizard that was installing some other things. I could see on the progress details, it said it was installing the SDK.it downloaded and installed some other things. But about quarter of the way.The internet got pretty slow on my phone so I decided to cancel the installation.and I'm on the latest version of unity: 2017.3.1f1 I have installed android studio 3.0.1 and the latest SDK + JKD files. I entered the correct file path for the SDK amp JDK in unity but i'm getting errors: https://imgur.com/a/DKHdX EDIT: Been stuck with this for two days, nothing seems to work. Here are some more screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/9hU2M EDIT: Thank you everyone that helped. I've got it working now, I think it came down to changing the android SDK tools version to r25.2.5 Sorry if there is a simple fix, I was excited that I was finally going to be publishing the game but am frusrated right now because it doesn't seem to want to build. Thanks in this guide (https://forum.xda-developers.com/google-nexus-5/general/guide-nexus-5-how-to-unlock-bootloader-t2507905) that i saw they said to download the android sdk from here (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#download) (scroll to the bottom of the pagegtDOWNLOAD FOR OTHER PLATFORMSgtSDK Tools Only) so i download it but the file names are different (probably because it is an old guide) so i'm asking what do i need to do when he says "android-sdk-windows" what folder
